## Description
In this project i explore a dataset from the subsription-based streaming service Netflix. The raw data is available in [kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows/?select=netflix_titles.csv)
In the raw data, each TV show and movie has a show-id. Also you can see the title, director, cast, the dated where the movie or Tv show was added, release year, rating, duration, genre and description.
I will use tableau to create an interactive dashboard of this dataset. There you can choose any Movie or Tv show to get the duration, rating, release year, date added, genre and description.

## Process 
Before preparing the data for tableau, i used pandas to explorate and clean the data. Code is available [here!](https://github.com/ptrutnau/Netflix_Dashboard/blob/main/Netflix_dashboard/data_cleaning.ipynb)
